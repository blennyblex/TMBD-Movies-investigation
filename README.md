# Project: Investigate a Dataset (TMBD MOVIES)
## by Blessing Egharevba


## Introduction

> The TMBD Movies dataset contains information about 10866 movies, with information about the popularity, budget, revenue, casts, directors, production company, runtime, release date, release year, vote, among others.<br>
> The aim of this project is to investigate the data, explore, get information about it, get useful and data-driven insights by asking appropriate questions with the use of proper analysis and visualization tools. Investigate the sucess of a movie.


### The following conclusions were made
> - The success of a movie is not determined by how long the movie runs for.
> - The popularity of a movies has an effect on the success of that movie.
> - The success of a movie can be determined by the budget of that movie.
> - Movies directed by multiple directors on average, generate more revenue than movied direcetd by one director.
> - Most of the genres produced now weren't produced in the early years.
> - Some of the popular genres in the early years are still popular even now. Drama and Comedy movies are still the most popular movies genres produced.

### Limitations 

> - Some of the columns in the dataset has mulitple values. Attempts to clean them proved difficult based on my knowledge, so had to look for ways to clean them up, and make proper use of those columns.
> - Knowing the right columns to drop, that wont affect the analysis
> - Issues were faced in the determining in=f to drop budget and revenue with zero values. Is it possible to have a movie with zero budget? or a movie generating zero revenue? Should they be dropped? These questions askd led to a great limitation.
